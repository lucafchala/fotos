# Security Policy / Política de Segurança

`fotos.lucafchala.com` is a single Cloudflare Worker — a public photo gallery
with an admin dashboard and LGPD photo-removal / image-use-consent flows. We
take the security and privacy of visitors' data seriously and welcome
responsible disclosure.

## Reporting a vulnerability / Como reportar

- **Email:** security@lucafchala.com
- **PGP:** [`48E7 3F6F A287 1E7B 86EF EA64 8EC4 329A 369B 7B33`](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/48E73F6FA2871E7B86EFEA648EC4329A369B7B33) — please encrypt sensitive reports.
- **Languages:** English, Português (pt-BR)

This policy is also published in machine-readable form at
[`/.well-known/security.txt`](https://fotos.lucafchala.com/.well-known/security.txt) (RFC 9116).

Please include a description of the issue and its impact, steps to reproduce
(a proof of concept, the affected URL/endpoint), and any logs, requests, or
screenshots that help. **Do not open a public GitHub issue for security
problems — email first**, and please give us a reasonable window to fix the
issue before any public disclosure.

## Scope / Escopo

**In scope:**

- The production site `https://fotos.lucafchala.com` and its `*.workers.dev`
  deployment.
- The Worker code in this repository (`src/`): the admin dashboard
  (`/dashboard`), the public APIs (`/api/*`), and the LGPD removal/consent
  flows.

**Out of scope / known by design:**

- **Google Drive links are shareable.** Photos are delivered via Google Drive
  links. Once a legitimate visitor passes the consent gate, the link can be
  reshared — that is inherent to Drive sharing, not a vulnerability.
- **The Drive gate is currently client-side.** `DRIVE_URL` / `DRIVE_URL_IG`
  are embedded in the page, so the links can be read from page source / the
  browser console without passing the Turnstile + Terms gate. Moving link
  delivery behind a server-side-verified endpoint is tracked in
  [`TODO.md`](./TODO.md) (Etapa 3.1).
- Best-effort, non-atomic counters (`views`, `drive_clicks`): undercounting
  under load is expected.
- Rate limits are abuse-mitigation, not a hard guarantee.
- Automated-scanner output with no demonstrated impact, "best-practice" header
  nitpicks already covered by our CSP/HSTS, volumetric DoS, and
  social-engineering reports.

## Response / Prazo de resposta

This is a personal project maintained by one person. We aim to **acknowledge
reports within 5 business days** and to fix confirmed, high-impact issues as
quickly as is reasonable. We'll keep you updated and are happy to credit you if
you'd like.
